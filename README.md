### What is Mini-NDN?

Mini-NDN is a lightweight networking emulation tool that enables testing, experimentation, and
research on the NDN platform. Based on [Mini-CCNx](https://github.com/chesteve/mn-ccnx) which
is a fork of [Mininet](https://github.com/mininet/mininet), Mini-NDN uses the NDN libraries,
NFD, NLSR, and tools released by the [NDN project](http://named-data.net/codebase/platform/)
to emulate an NDN network on a single system.

Mini-NDN is open and free software licensed under the GPL 3.0 license. Mini-NDN is free to all
users and developers. For more information about licensing details and limitations,
please refer to [COPYING.md](COPYING.md).

The first release of Mini-NDN is developed by members of the NSF-sponsored NDN project team.
Mini-NDN is open to contribution from the public.
