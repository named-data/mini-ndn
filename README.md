### What is Mini-NDN Wifi?

Mini-NDN Wifi is a lightweight Wi-Fi networking emulation tool that enables testing, experimentation, and
research on the NDN platform. Based on [Mini-NDN](https://github.com/named-data/mini-ndn) which
is a fork of [Mininet-wifi](https://github.com/mininet/mininet), Mini-NDN Wifi uses the NDN libraries,
NFD, NLSR, and tools released by the [NDN project](http://named-data.net/codebase/platform/)
to emulate an NDN network on a single system.

Mini-NDN Wifi is open and free software licensed under the GPL 3.0 license. Mini-NDN Wifi is free to all
